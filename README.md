# seminar applied mathematics


The repository contains interesting projects in which I participated during the "applied mathematics" semianrium. The purpose of the seminar was to allow students to create projects for external companies. Each project was created in groups of 3-4 people.

During the seminar I participated in three different projects:

- project 1: prediction of air pollution in Warsaw for the company Airly

The goal of the project was to create a model that made smog pollution predictions for the next day. We used a neural network created in keras (MLP not RNN), the input was weather data and information on whether the day was free from work.

- project 2: modeling mainframe computer sales for the company IBM

In the project we created a model for selling mainframe computers. Each computer is supported up to four generations back, each IBM customer when a new generation comes out has to decide whether to buy a new computer, stay with the old one, or switch suppliers. The model also takes into account the influx of new customers. Our model took user parameters like the number of kilents of a given generation and made a prediction of estimated sales. (We did not use ML models)


- project 3: creating a schedule for nurses for the company fourteen33

The project uses the ampl language to find the best schedule for nurses. Creating a schedule for nurses is determined by many difficulties, e.g. a nurse cannot work two nights at a time, nurses may prefer to work with different nurses, no nurse wants to work on weekends, etc. We have developed a program that finds a suitable solution in a linear fashion.

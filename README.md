# seminar applied mathematics


The repository contains interesting projects in which I participated during the "applied mathematics" semianrium. The purpose of the seminar was to allow students to create projects for external companies. Each project was created in groups of 3-4 people.

During the seminar I participated in three different projects:

- project 1:
prediction of air pollution in Warsaw for the company Airly

- project 2:
modeling mainframe computer sales for the company IBM

- project 3:
creating a schedule for nurses for the company fourteen33

# seminar applied mathematics


The repository contains interesting projects in which I participated during the "applied mathematics" semianrium. The purpose of the seminar was to allow students to create projects for external companies. Each project was created in groups of 3-4 people.

During the seminar I participated in three different projects:

- project 1: prediction of air pollution in Warsaw for the company Airly
The goal of the project was to create a model that made smog pollution predictions for the next day. We used a neural network created in keras (MLP not RNN), the input was weather data and information on whether the day was free from work.

- project 2: modeling mainframe computer sales for the company IBM

- project 3: creating a schedule for nurses for the company fourteen33
